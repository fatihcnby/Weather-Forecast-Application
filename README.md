<h1>Weather-Forecast-Application</h1>

With the application, which has a simple design, you can quickly find out the weather conditions of the city you want. 

Weather options include humidity, wind and felt temperature information.

I used Html5 and Css for its design.

I used Javascript to get instant weather information.

I opted for a custom API for weather.
